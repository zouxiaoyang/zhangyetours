    <h3>Travel Tips on Coloured Mountains China</h3>
	<p>1.	June to September is the best season to visit Zhangye Danxia. Due to the strong ultraviolet in summer, we suggest you making a good preparation to avoid sunburn ahead of time. You should not go to the park in the noon in summer.</p>
   
    <p>2.	As the scenic spot consists of sandy soil, you’d better wear the caravan shoes with high uppers.</p>

    <p>3.	There are no stores in Zhangye Danxia Geopark, you should make enough preparation for food and water.</p>
	<p>4.	The Zhangye Danxia landform is fragile, and one step may not be recovered in hundreds of years. So many places in the zone are set up fences to remind people to follow the system in the Scenic spot to avoid stepping on the red landform out of the fences.</p>
	<p>5.	As the fourth platform is the best spot for sightseeing, lots of people will come here to take pictures of the sunset. Please do not set up photographic equipments out of the fences to achieve your purpose of photography. This does harm to your own safety as well as the scenic spot.</p>
	<p>6.	The public toilets in the park are adequate. They are set in the first, second, third and fourth platforms.</p>
	<p>7.	The best accommodations near the scenic spot are three- stars hotels with fine and clean environment. But the price is high in busy seasons, so you’d better order your hotel ahead of time.</p>
	<p>8.	Zhangye Danxia Lanform is popularized since 2002, so some facilities and service in the spot still need to be improved because of the short development time.
