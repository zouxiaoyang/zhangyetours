    <h3>Transport </h3>
	<p>The Rainbow Mountain is 40 kilometers from the city for about half an hour to get there. You can choose two ways as follows:</p>
    <h5>1.Private Vehicle</h5>
    <p>ZhangyeTravel offers you private car rental service and the driver will pick you up at the appointed time or place. We can assure you that the touring bus is highly regular and safe with licensed driver. And the specific renting fee is different in accordance with the travelling time. You can ask our consultant about this.</p>
    <h5>2.Public Buses</h5>
    <p>You can choose the scheduled bus for 10 Yuan from West Zhangye Station to Linze County or Sunan County and get off at the entrance of the scenic area. The bus starts every hour from nine to twelve in the morning and starts once at three thirty or four thirty in the afternoon. Although the cost is cheap, you will miss the chance for watching the sunrise or sunset. You can also choose to take the bus to Zhangye in the afternoon to watch sunset and live overnight in the hotel near the scenic area.</p>
